## Crossword Maker

## How to Run
 - Run `npm install` | `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
 - Run `npm start`   | `yarn run` to run the app locally.
 - You can find the project running on `localhost:3000`.

## To Create a Crossword
 - First, choose your theme. Ideally, these terms will be **across** rather than **down** and placed symmetrically on the board. In the image below, for example, the terms for the theme Game of Thrones are placed at 1, 11, and 21 **across**.
 - Write out your clues in the text boxes on the right. Scroll down for 'Down'.
 - Next, use Fill Square to fill in some black squares around your initial terms. Be sure to maintain rotational symmetry (a feature to help you out with this is coming soon)!
 - Build off of your theme, filling in black squares as necessary.
 - A very useful tool is [[https://onelook.com/](https://onelook.com/thesaurus/)]. If, for example, you need a word that starts with N and ends with T, you can search "N??T" to get a list of words and phrases to use. You can sort by most common, most lyrical, and part of speech.
 - Finally, number your clues. Start from the top left and work your way right and down, like reading a book. The **across** and down **clues** may share some numbers.
 - You've made your crossword! Take a screenshot of your solution. To have someone solve your puzzle, delete all the text (the black squares, numbers, and clues will remain). Remember not to refresh the page, or your puzzle will disappear (fix coming soon)!

## Features Coming Soon
- Save and load crosswords. Currently, refreshing the page erases progress.
- Switch between horizontal and vertical typing. Currently, you can only type horizontally without clicking around.
- Skip over black squares. Currently, typing continues underneath the black square.
- Add/delete lines for clues. Currently, number of clues is hard-coded.
- Change grid size. Currently, grid is set as 9x9.
